      "description": "I'm Khuanita Bright. Pronounced: 'Koo-uh-nee-ta'. A bit unconventional, I know (thanks a lot mom and dad), but Iâ€™ve heard it pronounced a million different ways before so it doesnâ€™t really matter. I prefer going by KB anyway.\n Iâ€™ve been in the industry for 7 years, in which I've grown from a content manager to a front-end developer in 2017, when I graduated from a course in web development, where I learned HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript. Since then, Iâ€™ve been coding in React Js and React-native with a firm knowledge of Typescript (thank God for hooks, right?). \n I'd describe myself as a level-headed person with a rational approach to problem solving combined with a passion for innovation and fresh ideas. I am able to use discipline in an appropriate manner and set high goals, then work hard (with my team) to achieve them. \n I love binging on foreign language Netflix series, Korean, Italian, French, you name it.. (with subtitles, of course), coffee and family time. Iâ€™m a mom to a very sassy 3 year old daughter. \n I'm very interested in growing and working with positive people on ambitious projects.",
